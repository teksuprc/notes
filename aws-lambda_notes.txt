# AWS Lambda Notes

## Lambda

    only worried about code
    auto scales
    max 15 minutes (900)
    only tcp/ip supported
    
    used w/ API gateway you can control throttling
    available in all availability zones and regions

    java
        MyOutput handlerName(MyEvent event, Context ctx) {}

    Output handlerName(event, context)

    push, pull, or direction call to activate function

    deployment packages
        node, python, java, c#
            zip files
        npm/pip         maven      nuget
        root level         /lib     dll's at root level

    architecture
        code handler -> lambda func -> IAM allow lambda to assume role -> upload code
         -> lambda call -> aws cloudwatch

    possible need to use Route53 for endpoints

    trust and access policies

    push model
        needs trust policy
        resource policy

    pull model
        needs trust policy
        needs execution policy

    lambda layers
        centrally manage code across multiple functions
        also for shared deps

    pricing
        execution, memory, and runtime in ms

    triggers not available
        alexa
        glacier deep archive
        lambda events (high side)
