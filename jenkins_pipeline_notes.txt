jenkins pipeline notes

scripted pipeline:

node {
	state('Example') {
		... do stuff
		
		try {
			sh 'pwd'
		}
		catch(err) {
			echo 'failed to do stuff'
			throw
		}
	}
}

Steps:
	tells jenkins what to do. basic building block for both declarative and scripted pipeline syntax.
	
Nodes:
	is a step that does 2 things:
		1) schedules steps, adding to build queue.
		2) creates a workspace, file dir, workspaces last for the duration of the task.
		
Stage:
	is a step that calls supported APIs. each stage can have 1 or more build steps.
		
master:
	basic install of jenkins on a computer. handles tasks for build system. 
		pipeline scripts are parsed on master.
		steps wrapped in node blocks are performed on executors.
		
agent:
	(slave) is a computer used to offload projects from master. operations are performed by executors.
	
executor:
	computational resource for compiling code. run on master or agents.
