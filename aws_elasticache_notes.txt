# Machine Learning

	2 things
		aquire knowledge - rules that explain observations
		inference - ability to aquire knowledge to make plans

	supervised
		a teacher 
		
		algorithms:
			binary classification - label in 2 possible ways
			regression - solves a numeric value based on input parameters
			linear function - find a line thru the data
			logistic regression - apply log curve
			svm - support vector machine - 
			perceptron - ann - artificial neural network
			
			random forest
			xgboost - strong classifier out of many weak classifiers
		
	unsupervised
		cluster algorithms
		random cut forest
		topic modeling - top words that define the topic
		k-means clustering - 
		principal component analysis (pca) - reduces dimensionality within dataset
		latent dirichlet allocation (lda) - topic modeling
		anomoly detection
		hot spot detection - id dense regions in data
		
	reinforcement
		learning environment via trial and error
		
	deep learning
		neural networks
			vector of numeric input values
			weighted sum then activation function
		cnn's
		
		

# AWS SageMaker

	fully managed service
	build, train, and deploy ML models
	3 major components
		sagemaker notebooks service
		sagemaker training service
		sagemaker hosting service

	pip or conda install package deps and they will persist on the notebook instance
	
	type and # of EC2 instances needed... aws builds the training environment and tears down the environment
	add custom algorithms via docker images

### Challenges

	1) which framework
	2) create models
	3) train models to make predictions
	4) integrate into an application
	5) deployment
	
	SageMaker NEO = framework to NEO conversion to platform
		neo compiler
		neo runtime library
		
		
	
	

# AWS Authentication and Authorization IAM - Identity and Access Management

### User
	a perminently named operator
		credentials are perminent and attached to user (authentication method)

### Group
	a collection of users

### Role
	is not your permissions
	is an authentication method
	creds are temporary

### Policy Docs
	authorization
	json doc
	attached to a user, group, or role
	lists apis that are allowed and on which resources
	lists conditions access is allowed
	
	object -> api -> s3
		put with creds 

	explicit deny - overrides any allow statement, can perminently prevent actions
	functions NEED to be whitelisted, else there is an implicit deny
	

# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
	
### Storage types
	
	Block
		storage arrays on disks
		EBS - elastic block storage
		
	File
		ntfs, etc... contains attributes such as permissions
		EFS - elastic file system
			simple scalable for EC2 instances or on prem via direct connect

	Object 
		flat system stored as objects
		almost limitless storage
		S3 - simple storage service
		
	pay for what you use
	11 9's of durability 99.999999999%
	storage classes and transitions
		S3 standard
			pay for object stored
			pay for request charges

		S3 intelligent-tiering
			pay for object stored
			pay monthly monitoring fee
			pay for delete, overwritten, transitioned btwn storage classes before minimum storage has passed (30 day)

		S3 standard - infrequent access
		S3 One Zone - infrequent access
			pay for objects stored
			pay for delete, overwritten, transitioned btwn storage classes before minimum storage has passed (30 day)
			pay for object size (128 kb)

		S3 Glacier
			pay for objects stored
			requests per object and per byte restored
			deleting an object before 90 day minimum commitment
			put, copy, or transition - higher than S3
			fixed amount of storage (requires 32kb per object) (min 8kb object size)
			
		S3 Glacier Deep Archive
			pay for objects stored
			request per object and per byte restored
			delete object before 180 days
			min 8kb object size
			requires 32kb per object
			put, copy, or transition
		
	stored objects in buckets
	object 
		data
		metadata
		access via
			Amazon S3 console
			aws cli
			aws sdk(api)
		
##### Use cases
		backup storage
		media hosting
		application assets
		data lake
		content delivery
		
##### Charges in S3
	
	pay as you go
	pay what you use
	
	storage 			- based on object size, how long during month, and storage class	
	requests			- get, put, copy, and lifecycle actions (30 days of inactivity) transition from s3 storage class to s3 archive storage
	management			- management features, inventory, analytics, and object tagging
	data transfer		- all data in/out except: 
							in from internet
							out from EC2 within same Region as S3
							out to CloudFront
	storage classes		- see above
	
	Cost Explorer API 	- has a charge for access
	
	
	

# AWS Elasticache

### in memory data store in the cloud

	fast managed in-memory data store
	
	cache node - fixed sized
		can be single or clustered
		each node runs an instance of either (memcached or redis)
		
		apps using redis or memcached should be able to use elasticache w/ almost no modification
		used for high performance use cases
		
		great for small static data, or metadata
		great for compute workloads
		
		memcached can scale to 20 nodes per cluster
		redis can scale to 90 nodes per cluster
		
		redis - HA through multiple availablility zones
		memcached - data is partitioned across all nodes in cluster
		
	Lazy Loading
		load data in cache only when necessary
		
		server -> cache -> backing db
					(if data is current) else data is grabbed from db
					
	Write Throught
		updates cache when data is changed, then written to db
		server -> cache -> db 
					(cache updates db)
					
	Adding TTL
		Time to live - number of seconds or ms for data to expire
